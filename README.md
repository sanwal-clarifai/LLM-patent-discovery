# Streamlit module for asking questions of PDFs of patents. The patents must be all in one folder where you can 

1. Read PDFs into memory
2. Run those texts through GPT-4 or other LLMS (keep adding functionality by adding more of the options in the drop down)
3. Output answers in a csv that is downloadable.
